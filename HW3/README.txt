There are 3 different files:

1)  Running decision.py will print out data on all the folds and averages of all folds and create lots of files.
    the decision-tree pdfs are visualizations of all the decision trees. The number in the file name indicates which
    fold it was created on. It will also output 3 html files that are the performance vs baseline graphs for recall,
    precision and F1.

2)  Running kmeans.py will output 4 html files. One is the graph for the elbow method of determining k, the other
    3 are the result of running kmeans clustering with different values of k.

3)  Running plots.py will output 2 htmls files. They plot all of the data just color coded in different ways: one
    by location and the other by osha class.
